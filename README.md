After I installed two VM, wich act as front-end (web) and back-end (app) servers:

After that I wrote script, wich automaticaly deploy httpd and tomcat servers, connected them on servers wich I installed erlier (web and app). On last screenshot I showed that we can connect to web server over IP and get tomcat's start-page:

Directory "sourse" contains only screenshots for task. 
File "vagrantfile" contains config for deployment two VM over Virtualbox.
File "web.sh" contains scripts for deployment httpd and mod_jk. 
File "app.sh" contains scripts for deployment tomcat.
